# Agri-Bot AI: Crop Health Forecasting Agent 

**Agri-Bot AI** is a precision agriculture platform that integrates Deep Learning (GRU) for time-series forecasting with Large Language Models (LLM) for natural language interpretation. The system provides farmers with 7-day crop health forecasts (NDVI) and actionable agronomic insights via a conversational interface.



##  System Architecture

This project operates on a hybrid architecture that separates **Data Engineering**, **Predictive Modeling**, and **Agentic Inference**.

### 1. The Model (Deep Learning)

* **Architecture:** Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Neural Network.

* **Input:** Multivariate time-series data including Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, ERA5 weather data, and SMAP soil moisture readings.

* **Lookback Window:** 60 Days.

* **Target:** NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) forecasting for the next 7 days.

* **Validation:** Evaluated on "Zero-Shot" regions (unseen geographic locations) to ensure generalization capabilities.

### 2. The Agents (Inference Engine)

The application logic is decoupled into specialized agents:

* **`CropHealthModelAgent` (The Tool):** Loads the trained `.keras` model and Scalers. It handles the raw data retrieval, feature scaling, and numeric inference.

* **`CropHealthChatbotAgent` (The Brain):** An LLM-driven agent (Llama 3 via Groq) that interprets the numeric output from the Model Agent. It translates raw NDVI data into human-readable advice (e.g., detecting stress, recommending irrigation).

### 3. Data Pipeline (Research)

* **Preprocessing:** Handled via Jupyter Notebooks (see `pre-processing_notebooks/` folder) to merge spatial coordinates with temporal weather data.

* **Training:** The model was trained on distinct growing seasons to handle phenological variability.

## Quick Start (Inference Only)

To run the chatbot, you do **not** need to re-run the training pipeline. The application relies on the pre-trained artifacts in the `machine_learning/` and `data/` folders.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+

* [Groq API Key](https://console.groq.com/) (for LLM inference)

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the production dependencies.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/croplogic-ai.git cd croplogic-ai pip install -r requirements.txt


### 2. Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your API key securely:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=2


### 3. Run the Command Center

Launch the Streamlit application. This will initialize the Agents and load the GRU model into memory.

streamlit run app.py


## Evaluation & Results

The system was rigorously tested using two distinct evaluation sets:

1. **SET 1 (Growing Season):** Validating performance during peak vegetative stages.

2. **SET 2 (Non-Growing Season / Zero-Shot):** Testing model robustness on unseen data and dormant crop stages.

* **Training Script:** `scripts/train_v6_gru.py`

* **Evaluation Script:** `scripts/evaluate_zeroshot.py`

## Repository Layout

* **`app.py`**: Main application frontend (Streamlit Dashboard).

* **`run_chatbot.py`**: Alternative entry point for the chatbot interface.

* **`ai_agent/`**: Contains the source code for the AI agents (`CropHealthChatbotAgent` and `CropHealthModelAgent`).

* **`machine_learning/`**: Stores the trained model artifacts (`.keras` files), scalers (`.pkl`), and training results (JSONs).

* **`data/`**: Contains the cleaned parquet datasets used for mapping and historical context.

* **`pre-processing_notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, feature engineering, and coordinate extraction.

* **`scripts/`**: Python scripts used for training the GRU model and running performance evaluations.

* **`photos/`**: Project assets and images.

* **`.env`**: Configuration file for API keys and environment variables (excluded from version control).

* **`poetry.lock` / `pyproject.toml`**: Dependency management files.
